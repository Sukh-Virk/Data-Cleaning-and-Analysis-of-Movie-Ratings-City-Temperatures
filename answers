1.Only using temperature to predict population is not accurate. For example, there are places that are cold that have a decent population.
For example, Vancouver right now although, it is snowy and cold has a decent population. Further, there are hot places that have little small
populations. For instance the Sahara desert. Also, temperatures can change a lot throughout the day. For example, it can go from very cold at night to decently warm throughout the day. This has nothing to do with population. Also, there are other factors we need to look at to help
determine population.


2. Using my knowledge from previous classes, it would make sense that using compressed files would help increase efficency because there is 
less amount of memory and power needed to do that compared to reading a whole file. This is another reason why many professors ask for compressed files when handing in work. Also compressed files have a reduced size making it easier to work with in comparison to a file that is uncompressed.
